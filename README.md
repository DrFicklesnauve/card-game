# React Card Game
## Created by: Joshua Kardell

In early 2020, I decided to start learning React on my own. I got through part of the tutorial when I decided to use some of the React techniques I learned in the tutorial to make my own card game. Some of the things I specifically wanted to showcase was the use of state, destructuring of that state, the use of components (though it would be better to have them in separate files), and inline boolean statements that I had seen before but had not understood before now.
